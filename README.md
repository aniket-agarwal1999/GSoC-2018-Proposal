# GSoC-2018-Proposal
My GSoC 2018 proposal for FOSSASIA org.
This proposal is mainly for the SUSI.AI division of the FOSSASIA org.

The main aim of my proposal is to improve the feature set of SUSI.AI android app. So intend to solve some of the prominant bugs in the app and also include some of the essential features in the app. Although I was not selected as a GSoC student, it was indeed an enriching experience for me :smile:
